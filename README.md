Data Science Internship

Task 1- Stock Prediction :
Take stock price of any company you want and predicts its price by using LSTM Use only Jupyter notebook code.
source of datset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainilcoder/netflix-stock-price-prediction

Task 2- Titanic Classification :
Make a system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking. What factors were most likely lead to success-socio-economic status, age, gender and more.
I did logistic regression here for the prdiction. And the factors that took as indepedent variables which contribute the prediction are 'Pclass', 'Age', 'Sex'.

Task 3-Number Recognition :
Handwritten digit recognition system not only detects scanned images of handwritten digits.Handwritten digit recognition using MNIST dataset is a major project made with the help of Neural Network. It basically detects the scanned images of handwritten digits.
Used CNN model and got 98.94 accuracy.The test loss was too low and test accuracy was high thus it can conlcuded that the model built is good for both training and testing dataset thus the model built is a better one.The predicted values was visually represented.
